# Salut
The Salut protocol is a Swift 4 protocol for encrypted data transfer via Bonjour. It uses symmetric encryption and md5 hashing to transfer data.

# Installation

Salut requires `CryptoSwift`. View their [installation instructions](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift) first.

To install Salut, simply drop the source files in `src` into your XCode app.

# Usage

## Getting a peer ID

Getting a MCPeerID is easy. On iOS simply use:
```swift
let id = MCPeerID(displayName: UIDevice.current.name)
```
On macOS you have to use:
```swift
let id = MCPeerID(displayName: Host.current().name ?? "Mac")
```

## Getting a password

Your password needs to be 32 alphanumeric symbols long. To generate a 32 symbols long md5 hash just use:
```swift
let code = "myPasswordOfVariableLength".md5()
```
Note that the md5 extension is part of CryptoSwift.

## Setting up a Salut Server

Before you start, you have to run the server on the device you want to connect to.

```swift
let server = SalutServer(peerId: id), password: code)
server.prepare()
server.delegate = self
```

## Running the Salut Client

Similarly to the server, just initialize a client on your device, from which you want to send information, with:
```swift
let client = SalutClient(peerId: id, password: code)
client.prepare()
client.delegate = self
```

## Setting the password on running clients or servers

To reset your password on the fly, simply call:
```swift
// Server
server.setPassword(newCode)
// Client
client.setPassword(newCode)
```

## Establishing a connection

Have your server and your client running. On your client, call:
```swift
salut.sendSearchRequest()
```
If the password is correct and the server gets the message, he will respond to the client. The client then calls the delegate method:
```swift
func client(_ client: SalutClient, recievedDecryptableSearchResponse response: String) {
    // Handle successful connection, e.g. save password and start sending messages
}
```

## Sending data

When you established a connection or your password always is the same and therefore you do not have to check for password correctness first, call:

```swift
salut.sendData(dataString)
```

On your server, the data will be received and decrypted. Use the server delegate method 

```swift
func server(_ server: SalutServer, receivedDecryptedTransmission data: String) {
    // Handle data
}
```
